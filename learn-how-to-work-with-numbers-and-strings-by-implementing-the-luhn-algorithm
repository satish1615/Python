# Python comes with built-in classes that can help us with string manipulation. 
One of them is the str class. 
It has a method called maketrans that can help us create a translation table. 
This table can be used to replace characters in a string:

  Example Code
  str.maketrans({'t': 'c', 'l': 'b'})
  The above, when called on a string, will replace all t characters with c and all l characters with b.
